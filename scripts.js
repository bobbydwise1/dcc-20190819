/*
Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You have an N by N board. Write a function that, given N, returns the number of possible arrangements of the board where N queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other, i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

console.log(root)

$(document).ready(function() {
  $('#form1').submit(function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  let input1 = $('#input1').val();
  $('#output-section-1').text(input1);
  })
});
